                <br><p> This Company was funded on 24 June 2021 by <b>Moose Harrison</b> who is the Owner of the company. 
                  We work with broilers and we make sure that we put more good looking chickens that weight over 2kg.
                Our Company started off with a single employee that would check on the chickens daily.
                In November 2021 we started to produce profitable chickens even though we were under staffed.
                We always aim to produce the best and most desirable meat while delivering its services
                online to any one who is willing to order a broiler chicken.This will provide a speedy service while
                customers are using this website.We are under staffed and if you are interested you can come to the factory/farm
                or send us an email.

                 <br><p> This company started from being planned.After 5 more years of experiments and discoveries we managed to open our business.
                 "It was not easy to make my dream to come true, I only thought that it was only a dream and i could not own a boiler farm. I started experimenting  with
                 a single boiler by giving it high protein feed delivered through an automated feeding system.After my first experiment i realized that i can make more 
                 health chickens that are healthy and have a mass of more than 2kg per chicken".Healthy chicken company existed because our CEO believed and had hope for this idea.
                 Healthy Chicken is located at North West with a close association of small businesses catering companies while supplying quality poultry to businesses.Over few 
                 months we have adapted to supply a great product and maintain a low cost base.
                 
                 Healthy chickens is dedicated to provide a quality service to all of our customers.</p>

                            We hope to own more farms of the poultry with more <b>LED light systems</b> that will help me to improve  energy efficiently
                             including to improve the light spectrum inside for the chickens to have an improved natural daylight.
